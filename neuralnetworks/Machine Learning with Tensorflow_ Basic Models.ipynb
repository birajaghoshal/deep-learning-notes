It's used extensively because it simple and highly interpretable , interpretation of results is a very important while deep neural networks are hard to interpret and are similar to a blackbox , statistical models can be interpreted easily , and it is very important to understand how to implement it and its various flavors. . We end up with a number for each feature that directly represents how that feature influences the target or dependent variable.We will introduce how linear regression can be classically implemented, and then move on to how to best implement it in TensorFlow. \n","\n","We start by implementing the simplest linear regression model using mean squared error , we can also use different loss functions such as Ridge (L1) and Lasso (L2) or both (ElasticNet)\n","\n","As an exercice to the reader , you can use the same code but only change the value of the loss function to see how different functions give slightly different results ."]},{"metadata":{"id":"lghXZFcVzvbh","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import tensorflow as
